# Image Representation Gizmo

A simple toy to explore how images are stored digitally. This demonstration lets you play with bit depth to see how nuance is introduced with more bits of color resolution. 

Pick a shade from what's available at the selected bit depth, and click on a pixel to paint it!

The text display below the image shows a rudimentary text representation of the image. This is *one* possible way to represent the information of the image as text. As you hover over pixels in the image, the corresponding value will be highlighted in the text display.
